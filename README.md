# Hoturn Navigator

**A local-first AI manager for reliable, structured and privacy-respecting interaction with AI.**  
Public teaser repository (v0.1-alpha)

Hoturn Navigator is an open-source project designed to make AI usage accessible to everyone — including students, migrants, NGOs, and non-technical users.  
It provides a simple, beginner-friendly workflow that connects personal knowledge (documents, PDFs, books) with AI models in a secure and efficient way.

## 🌍 Vision

Modern AI tools are powerful but often expensive, complex and cloud-dependent.  
Hoturn Navigator aims to create a local-first alternative focused on:

- digital sovereignty  
- privacy  
- accessibility  
- simplicity  
- zero vendor lock-in  

The system allows users to store all AI conversations locally, organize knowledge, and efficiently retrieve information without relying on corporate ecosystems.

## 🧩 Project Structure

Hoturn Navigator will consist of four core modules:

1. **Hoturn Logger** – persistent local logging of AI interactions (core module, implemented)  
2. **Hoturn Analyst** – document parser & metadata extractor (in design)  
3. **Hoturn Librarian** – fast knowledge search engine (in design)  
4. **Hoturn Assembler** – automated document builder for AI prompts (in design)

The Logger module already exists in a private development repository.  
It will be refactored, documented, and published after milestone 1.

## 🔓 Open Source

The final project will be released as **free and open-source software (MIT License)**.

This repository currently contains:

- project description  
- initial folder structure  
- MIT license  

The full codebase will be made public after the grant agreement is signed and development reaches a stable stage.
